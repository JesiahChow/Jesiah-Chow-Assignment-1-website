# Jesiah-Chow-Assignment-1-website

This is a website on a rock band from Japan
Design Process:

During the design process, I was thinking of what content do I want to add in and the number of pages I want.
I went to their offical website for some inspiration and to find out what are their style like. In the process,
I found its mostly dark and so I chosed dark colours for my style.

This website is for people from all age of life. Its aim is to spread the popularity and for people to get to know this band and its music as it is one of the very few japanese bands that is able to gain recognition outside of Japan particularly in the west.

# Jesiah-Chow-Assignment-1-website

This is a website on a rock band from Japan
Design Process:

- During the design process, I was thinking of what content do I want to add in and the number of pages I want.
  I went to their offical website for some inspiration and to find out what are their style like. In the process,
  I found its mostly dark and so I chosed dark colours for my style.

- This website is for people from all walks of life. Its aim is to spread the popularity of this band and for people to get to know them especially the vocalist who is Japanese and is fluent in English which is rare for a Japanese band. I wan people to listen to their music as it is one of the very few japanese bands that is able to gain recognition outside of Japan particularly in the west and even won international musical awards.

Here is my design wireframe on Adobe XD: https://xd.adobe.com/view/1d31244b-4440-43d4-88d9-f4b739fdcc2b-4862/

Features:

- On the tour page. The collapsible buttons allow user to use see where the specific locations are for the tour which the user
  is able to click on them to know more information.

- The social media icons in the footer are linked to the actual band's social media accounts.

- For the rest of the pages, most of the images are clickable and will direct the user to the actual band's website where
  there are additional information to view.

- There is a form at the footer for users to fill in should they want to subscribe to their newsletter.

- I used Javascript for one of my pages. I get the element by class, created variables, functions and
  a for loop to implemented a collapsible button for the band's tours in the tour page.
  This is the website that I had referred from:

- https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp

- I implemented hover button so that when a user hover his/her cursor on the text a colour will pop out

Technologies:

- HTML : The primary language use for creating websites. For my website the main language I use is mostly HTML.
- CSS : A mark-up language to aid HTML language. I used it to style my website.
- Javascript : The language I had added in to implement human interactions.

Testing:
For testing, I have added a form in the footer for users to fill in should they want to subscribe to the band's newsletter.

1. Scroll down to the footer

2. Leave the email blank and hit subscribe to verify if an error message appear asking you to fill in the required fields.

3. Fill in the form but this time with a random text that is not an email to verify if an error message on invalid email appears.

4. This time, fill in the form with a valid email and click subscribe to verify if a success message will appear.

My website looks normal on Microsoft edge and Chrome. In addition, I had adjusted my website to fit in a mobile layout. For example, in the mobile layout of a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, every page will be in columns.

Bugs:
There was a bug i encountered when coding which is for my index and about page there is an band image at the center. When I added media query and changed the height and width in visual studio code while inspecting it manages to adjust perfectly but when I inspect the page after saving my code the image and restart the live server, it became stretched and when the media query is active my elements were cancelled with a line over it which I am unsure why. (In the end I managed to fix it.)
